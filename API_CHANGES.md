# slogo API Changes
The major changes to our API came after learning more about the benefits of Properties and Observable. This was the lecture after our initial design specification, so fortunately we were able to modify our design at a team meeting without any significant obstacles. Essentially, we converted our initial idea of using "Delta" objects to communicate changes in the model to the view into an Observable-Observer pattern. The view now watches the model and is notified whenever a significant change occurs. This meant the reduction of some of the intermediary-esque duties of the Controller portion of the design, though some views still require their own controllers for more advanced communication with the model.
